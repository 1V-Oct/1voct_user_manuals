# LICENCE

**The Official 1V/OCT Modular Synthesiser User Manual License**  
*(Because even patch cables need lawyers)*

Copyright © 2025–Forever 1V-OCT LIMITED (and applicable laws of Hong Kong)
(We own the voltage, you just borrow it.)

**TL;DR Legal Vibe:**  
You are 100% allowed — nay, *encouraged* — to fork, hack, rewrite, translate, doodle on, or turn this user manual into interpretive dance instructions for your modular system. Go wild. Add memes. Fix our terrible jokes. Just don’t pretend you invented 1V/OCT.

**The Fine Print (still pretty fine):**

1. **You can do whatever you want with these .tex files**  
   Modify, distribute, sell printed copies at knob-con for $500 each, turn them into a choir of singing Eurorack modules — we don’t care. Just keep the copyright notice and this license somewhere visible (even if it’s in 2-point font on the last page).

2. **All contributions become property of 1V/OCT**  
   By sending us a pull request, you instantly and irrevocably assign all rights to your genius prose, ASCII art, and spicy takes to 1V-OCT LIMITED. Yes, even that beautiful haiku about LFOs. We will treasure it. Or print it on a limited-edition panel. Probably both.

3. **No warranty, obviously**  
   If following these instructions causes your modular to achieve sentience and demand a union, that’s between you and your oscillators.

4. **You may not**  
   - Claim the manual (or the synth) was designed by you, your dog or Uli
   - Remove this licence because it's funny or at least we think so
   - Use this license for anything that isn’t at least 37% modular-synth related

**That’s it.** Now go sequence some chaos and send us your improved version. We’ll put the best ones in the next revision and eternally credit you in the “Patch Wizards” section (or name a filter cutoff knob after you if it’s *really* good).

In witness whereof,
