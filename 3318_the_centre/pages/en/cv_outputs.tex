\section{CV Outputs}
The Centre provides four independent VOUT outputs, each capable of outputting voltages in the range of -5V to +5V. These outputs can be configured to function not only as audio signal outputs but also as either control voltage (CV) outputs or gate outputs, depending on the selected mode of operation.
\subsection{Operation Modes}
\paragraph*{} To operate the VOUT outputs as CV outputs, navigate to the "Settings" menu and enable "CV to VOUT" mode.
