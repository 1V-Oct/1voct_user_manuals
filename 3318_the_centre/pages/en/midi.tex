\subsection{Introduction to MIDI}

\paragraph*{}Currently The Centre can handle MIDI notes in and out as well as CC codes. The Centre allows to create multiple MID modules to feed midi notes (note, gate, velocity) into other modules. Each MID module can respond on own channel.
\paragraph*{}Additinally The Centre enables control via CC codes either from PC computer or MIDI controller (via MIDI). 

\subsection{CC control}
\paragraph*{}To configure CC controlling an input go to inputs and press \textbf{[ASSIGN]} button and turn the CC controller on MIDI keyboard or send CC signal from DAW. The Assignment will be shown under selected control. Now sending CC signal will adjust particular settings.
