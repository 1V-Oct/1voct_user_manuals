  \paragraph*{}
  Rendom Note Generator (RNG) produces random notes.

  \showrefcardsection{rng}

  \subsection{Operation}
  \paragraph*{} Random Note Generator (RNG) produces random values for output of pitch, gate length and velocity. The randomistaion happens every time upon receiving trigger signal at Input:Trigger. The randomisation process can be controlled by selecting range of available notes and rests as well as predefines musical scale to limit generated pitches. 
  \newline$\blacksquare$ Without clock source the BPM is fixed at 120 BPM the pattern
  \newline$\bigstar$ The musical scale selection is not necessary as routing output of RNG through QNT (Quantiser) and limit available pitch there gives much better flexibility.
