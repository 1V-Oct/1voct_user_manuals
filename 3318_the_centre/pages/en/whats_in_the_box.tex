% The Buttons

% You might want to alternate between black and white buttons. It is very easy to change button caps. Just use pliers to remove the cap and put the other one.

Knobs Caps

The 8 "attenuator" knobs are naked because if you want to change face plate those caps sit very tight and they are hard to remove therefore I haven't installed them. It's very easy to install. Just position the pot in centre and put the cap pointing to the top. Thats it.

Washer + Nut Sets

I haven't put all those under big Level knobs. They are not necessary because there is no pressure applied and 4 already secures plate well. If you want all of them attached that's why they are inside this bag.
