\section{Software Update}

Software Update is the most important process to keep your unit updated with the latest features and bug fixes as well as to keep it safe from breaking during update process. 
Updating process is fairly simple from user perspective although there might be some issues with downloading files because of specific Internet Browser behaviour during downloading.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download latest firmware release from Github 
\url{https://github.com/1V-Oct/3318_the_centre_releases/releases}
%  - filename\: the_centre_v4.fwx
  \item  Copy downloaded firmware file into SD Card (make sure that the filename is: 'the\_centre\_v4.fwx' and it is in root directory of your card)
  \item Insert SD Card into The Centre
  \item Power on The Centre or perform Reset
%[[Reset|System Menu#Reset]]
  \item Go to [[System Menu]] and check firmware version. 
  \item[$\blacksquare$] \textit{NOTE: Sometimes Safari, Explorer and other browsers add some extra bits to the filename like  '(1)' or '\_1' to indicate that it is different file than already downloaded. Please rename the file to the correct name.}
